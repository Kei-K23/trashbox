## Installation

To use the **Trashbox** package, first ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can then get the package using the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/Kei-K23/trashbox
```

## Usage

### Move to Trash

To move a file to the trash, use the `MoveToTrash` function. This function takes the file path as an argument.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/Kei-K23/trashbox"
)

func main() {
	err := trashbox.MoveToTrash("path/to/your/file.txt")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Error moving to trash: %v", err)
	}
	fmt.Println("File moved to trash successfully.")
}
```

### Put Back from Trash

To restore a file from the trash, use the `PutBackFromTrash` function. Pass the filename (not the full path) that you want to restore.

```go
err := trashbox.PutBackFromTrash("file.txt")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Error putting back from trash: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println("File restored from trash successfully.")
```

### List Trash

To get a list of files in the trash, use the `ListTrash` function. This function returns a slice of metadata containing details about each file.

```go
files, err := trashbox.ListTrash()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Error listing trash: %v", err)
}

for _, file := range files {
	fmt.Printf("File: %s, Deleted At: %s, Size: %d bytes\n", file.Filename, file.DeletedAt, file.Size)
}
```

### Delete Permanently

To delete a file permanently from the trash, use the `DeletePermanently` function. Pass the filename (not the full path) of the file you want to delete.

```go
err := trashbox.DeletePermanently("file.txt")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Error deleting permanently: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println("File deleted permanently.")
```

### Auto Clean Trash

To automatically clean up files older than a specified number of days, use the `AutoCleanTrash` function. You can pass one or zero arguments, where the argument is the number of days.

```go
err := trashbox.AutoCleanTrash(30) // Deletes files older than 30 days
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("Error cleaning trash: %v", err)
}
fmt.Println("Old files cleaned from trash.")
```
